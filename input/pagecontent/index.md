### Description

The Violent Death and Overdose Reporting (VDOR) FHIR Implementation Guide is a working area and draft to be incorporated into the Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) FHIR Implementation Guide.

Violent Death and Overdose Reporting has been established as a workflow for both Coroner and Medical Examiner Case Management Systems and Law Enforcement.

For more information on the MDI FHIR IG, please see the guide at https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mdi/.

### Connection to the National Violent Death Reporting System

This Implementation Guide is not built to represent the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), though it is often used as a starting point for terminology alignment.

While this guide was developed with the support of NVDRS, it is neither the work thereof nor an official representation of NVDRS.

A CodeSystem has been defined based on the NVDRS Coding Manual within this Implementation Guide, which will be aligned and replaced in conjunction with community requirements as part of the Medicolegal Death Investigation FHIR Implementation Guide integration.

Welcome to the HL7 Violent Death and Overdose Reporting (VDOR) FHIR Implementation Guide.

This guide is a companion space to the HL7 Medicolegal Death Investigation (MDI) FHIR Implementation Guide (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/). It is intended to be used as a "draft" for testing MDI alignment with Violent Death and Overdose Reporting systems, such as the National Violent Death Reporting System (https://www.cdc.gov/nvdrs/about/index.html).

This guide will eventually be subsumed into the MDI FHIR IG if possible.
